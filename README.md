# EEG_TF
The EEG_TF is a MATLAB toolbox designed to visualize time-frequency maps (spectrograms and scalograms) of the signals.
The app uses MATLAB and EEGLAB to operate through the GUI.
EEG_TF toolbox can upload the data in the specific EEGLAB format (.set), any other data (2- or 3D) that can be passed to the GUI through the command line. Nevertheless, this toolbox is specifically designed to operate with EEG data where several subjects and several conditions are present. It allows comparison or merging of conditions, individual or group analysis, different settings of spectral decomposition and plotting.
